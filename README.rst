Triomino
====================

School project for 2nd year at university, the goal is to implement many functionalities of the game 'Triominoes' based on the starting blocs we developped during lessons and the final test.
The starting point for this project was the correction of the final test. These 'starting point' files have our teacher's, Christophe Demko, name and copyright at the top, and will most likely stay as they are.

Progress
--------

The first step, organising the files into a clean project structure, has been mostly completed. Development will now begin as of 23/11/2024
